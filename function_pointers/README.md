### What are function pointers and how to use them?

A **function pointer** is a pointer that points to the address of a function in memory. In C and C++, functions are stored in memory as well, and a pointer can be used to reference or call a function indirectly. This allows dynamic function calls, which is useful in scenarios like implementing callback mechanisms, event handlers, or even creating a table of function pointers (e.g., for a state machine or dispatching).

#### Basic Syntax for Function Pointers
To declare and use a function pointer, the syntax depends on the type of function you are pointing to. Here's an example:

1. **Declaring a function pointer:**

```c
// Define a function that takes an int and returns an int
int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}

// Declare a function pointer type that points to a function returning int and taking two ints as parameters
int (*func_ptr)(int, int);
```

2. **Assigning a function to the pointer:**

```c
func_ptr = add;  // Now func_ptr points to the 'add' function
```

3. **Calling a function via the pointer:**

```c
int result = func_ptr(2, 3);  // This calls 'add(2, 3)' through the function pointer
printf("Result: %d\n", result);  // Outputs: Result: 5
```

#### Use Cases for Function Pointers
- **Callback functions**: Passing function pointers as arguments to other functions allows dynamic execution of different code.
- **Event handling**: Function pointers are commonly used in event-driven programming to link events to handler functions.
- **Dynamic dispatch**: Using function pointers in structures (e.g., in state machines or polymorphism in C++) allows the behavior of a program to change at runtime.

### What does a function pointer exactly hold?

A function pointer holds the **memory address** of a function. More precisely, it stores the starting address of the code for a function in the program's executable memory. When you dereference the pointer (i.e., call the function via the pointer), the processor jumps to that address and starts executing the function code.

In the case of the example above, the pointer `func_ptr` holds the memory address of the `add` function. This address is not the same as the address of a data object; it's the address of the first byte of the function's machine code, which gets executed when the pointer is dereferenced.

### Where does a function pointer point to in virtual memory?

Function pointers point to the **text (or code) segment** of a program's memory, where the actual machine code for functions is stored. In most modern operating systems, a program's memory is divided into several segments, including:

- **Text segment**: Contains the executable code (functions).
- **Data segment**: Stores global and static variables.
- **Heap**: For dynamically allocated memory.
- **Stack**: For local variables, function calls, and return addresses.

When a program is executed, the loader maps the binary code of the program into memory, and the addresses of functions are part of the text segment. A function pointer holds the address to a function's location in this text segment.

In most cases, the address held by the function pointer is the entry point to the function â€” that is, the address of the first instruction of the function in memory.

#### Example:
If you have the following program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}

int main() {
    int (*func_ptr)(int, int);
    func_ptr = add;  // func_ptr now holds the address of 'add'
    printf("%d\n", func_ptr(3, 4));  // Calls 'add(3, 4)' through the pointer
    return 0;
}
```

When you run the program:
- The function `add` gets loaded into the text segment of memory.
- The function pointer `func_ptr` stores the address of the `add` function's first byte in memory.
- When `func_ptr(3, 4)` is called, the CPU jumps to that memory location and starts executing the code of the `add` function.

### Key Points:

- A **function pointer** is a pointer to a function, specifically storing its memory address.
- It points to the function's code in the **text segment** of the virtual memory.
- Function pointers are used for **dynamic function calls**, callbacks, and other advanced programming techniques.
