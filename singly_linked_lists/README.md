When to Use Linked Lists vs Arrays
Advantages of Arrays:
Random Access: Arrays provide constant-time access to any element using an index (O(1)).
Cache Efficiency: Arrays are stored in contiguous memory, so accessing elements is faster due to better cache utilization.
Simple Structure: Easy to declare and use.
Sorting and Searching: Arrays work efficiently with sorting and searching algorithms.
Disadvantages of Arrays:
Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size in most programming languages, requiring resizing or reallocation if more elements are needed.
Costly Insertions/Deletions: Adding or removing elements (except at the end) involves shifting elements, making these operations O(n).
Advantages of Linked Lists:
Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Inserting or deleting nodes is O(1) if the pointer to the target node is available.
No Waste of Memory: Memory is allocated as needed, avoiding the problem of unused allocated memory.
Disadvantages of Linked Lists:
No Random Access: Traversing to a specific element requires O(n) time.
Higher Memory Overhead: Each node in a linked list requires extra memory for the pointer/reference to the next node.
Cache Inefficiency: Nodes are not stored contiguously, so they may have worse cache performance.
Use Cases:
Use arrays for:
Fixed-size datasets.
Applications requiring frequent random access.
Scenarios with a known, predictable number of elements.
Use linked lists for:
Dynamic datasets with unknown or changing sizes.
Frequent insertions/deletions (especially in the middle).
When minimizing reallocation or shifting is essential.
How to Build and Use Linked Lists
A linked list consists of nodes, each containing:

Data: The actual value or payload of the node.
Pointer/Reference: A link to the next node in the list.
Types of Linked Lists:
Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node.
Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.
Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
Building a Singly Linked List:
Hereâ€™s an example in Python:

python

# Define the Node class
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # Data stored in the node
        self.next = None  # Reference to the next node

# Define the LinkedList class
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None  # Head (start) of the list

    # Add a node to the end
    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
        current.next = new_node

    # Print the list
    def print_list(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")

    # Delete a node by value
    def delete(self, data):
        current = self.head
        if current and current.data == data:
            self.head = current.next
            current = None
            return
        prev = None
        while current and current.data != data:
            prev = current
            current = current.next
        if current is None:
            print("Value not found")
            return
        prev.next = current.next
        current = None
Using the Linked List:
python
Copier le code
# Create a linked list
ll = LinkedList()
ll.append(10)
ll.append(20)
ll.append(30)

# Print the linked list
print("Linked List:")
ll.print_list()

# Delete a node
print("After deleting 20:")
ll.delete(20)
ll.print_list()
Applications of Linked Lists:
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Used in stacks, queues, and hash tables.
File Systems: Representing directories or blocks of data.
Undo/Redo Functionality: Managing history in applications.
Graphs: Representing adjacency lists.
